# JFlex Website

This is the repository for the JFlex web site at http://jflex.de

The web site is generated by Hakyll, mostly based on bootstrap and markdown.


## Dependencies

You will need the Haskell compiler `ghc`, preferably from the [Haskell
platform][1], which includes the package manager `cabal`.

You can then run

    cabal install hakyll

to get the [Hakyll][2] web site generator.


## Structure

Most of the content is in directory `pages` in the form of markdown or html
files, which have templates and css applied to them to form the website.

The content of `files` is copied verbatim to the site and contains
miscellaneous support files. Javascprit and CSS files are in `js` and `css`
respectively, and `templates` contains the template parts, including
navigation, header, footer, etc, that make up the site's pages.

Layout should mainly be controlled from `css/jflex.css` and `templates/*.html`,
content should all be in `pages/*.{md|html}`.

The build scripts expects the release `.tar.gz`, `.zip`, and `.sha1` files in
`release` which is not version controlled (supposed to be generated from a
tagged release version of the main jflex repo). The `docs/` directory is mostly
generated from the release files, but is version controlled (should be removed
once things are more integrated).


## Build

    ghc --make site
    ./site watch

Point your web browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000 to see the local version.

See `site --help` for further commands. The `site watch` command should
automatically pick up any edits you make in templates and markdown files. If
you change `site.hs` you need to recompile.
