# JFlex Website

This is the repository for the JFlex web site at http://jflex.de

The web site is generated by Hakyll, mostly based on bootstrap and markdown.


## Dependencies

You will need the Haskell compiler `ghc`, preferably from the [Haskell
platform][1], which includes the package manager `cabal`.

You can then run

    cabal install hakyll

to get the Hakyll[2] web site generator. 


## Build

    cabal build
    ./site watch

Point your web browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000 to see the local version.

See `site --help` for further commands. The `site watch` command should
automatically pick up any edits you make in templates and markdown files. If
you change `site.hs` you need to recompile.


## Deploy

To deploy, email Gerwin.
