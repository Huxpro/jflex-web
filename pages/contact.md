# Discussion lists

JFlex has three public mailing lists hosted by [sourceforge.net](http://sourceforge.net).

## Stay informed

`jflex-announce` is a mailing-list for notification on new JFlex releases and severe bugs. This list is read only and very low traffic. Your email address will be kept private.

## Discuss with other users and get help

`jflex-users` is a discussion list of developers who use JFlex.
It is the perfect place to ask for help, assist other users and discuss strange behaviours
before filing a bug.
The list is not moderated and writable for subscribers only. Your email address will only be
visible if you post to the list.
