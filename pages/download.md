# Download JFlex

JFlex is free software and available for
download from this page and a number of [mirrors](mirrors.html).

## FIXME
 | JFlex + documentation	      | jflex-1.6.1.tar.gz  	        | md5 |
 | JFlex maven plugin (sources)	| jflex-maven-plugin-1.6.1.zip	|	md5 |
 

The distribution includes [installation procedures](installing.html),
documentation, pre-compiled classes and source code of JFlex. The
package `jflex-maven-plugin` contains the source code of the JFlex
plugin for the [maven build tool](http://maven.apache.org). They are not
necessary to run or build JFlex, only to change the plugin itself.

The documentation for JFlex is also available [online](docu.html).

JFlex has three mailing lists: **jflex-announce** is low traffic and
read-only for announcements of new releases, **jflex-users** is for help
and discussions, and **jflex-devel** for developer discussions. If you
would like to subscribe to either of the first two, please enter your
email address below, check the appropriate boxes, and press `[subscribe]`.
For the developer list, see the [mailing lists](mailing.html) page.
