## What is it?

JFlex is a lexical analyzer generator (also known as scanner generator) for
Java, written in Java. It is also a rewrite of the very useful tool [JLex][5]
which was developed by Elliot Berk at Princeton University. As Vern Paxson
states for his C/C++ tool flex: They do not share any code though.

JFlex is designed to work together with the LALR parser generator [CUP][6] by
Scott Hudson, and the Java modification of Berkeley [Yacc BYacc/J][7] by Bob
Jamison. It can also be used together with other parser generators like
[ANTLR][8] or as a standalone tool.

## Is it free?
Yes. It is released under a permissive open-source BSD-style license and available for [download](download.html). See also [Copyright, License & Warranty](copying.html).

## What's new in version 1.6.1?

Version 1.6.1 is a maintenance release. It fixes all known defects of version 1.6.0.

 * Fixed issue #130, "in caseless mode, chars in regexps not accepted caselessly": Caseless option works again as intended.
 * Fixed issue #131, "re-enable scanning interactively or from a network byte stream": JFlex now throws an IOException when a Reader returns 0 characters.
 * New example, shows how to deal with Readers that return 0 characters.
 * Command line scripts work again in repository version (contributed by Emma Strubell)
 * New options `--warn-unused` and `--no-warn-unused` that control warnings about unused macros.
 * Fixed issue #125: `%apiprivate` and `%cup2` switches now no longer incompatible
 * Fix issue #133, "Error in skeleton.nested": Empty-string matches were taking precedence over `EOF` and caused non-termination. Now `EOF` is counted as the highest-priority empty match.
 * New warning when an expression matches the empty string (can lead to non-termination).

----------------------------


## What's new in version 1.6?

Version 1.6 further improves Unicode support, including Unicode version 7.0.
Further high-level changes are:

 * In `%unicode` mode, supplementary code points are now handled as single characters, rather than two code-units/chars.
 * New `\u{â€¦}` escape sequence allows code points (and whitespace-separated sequences of code points) to be specified as 1--6 hexadecimal digit values.
 * By default no `InputStream` constructor is included in the generated scanner. The capability to include one is deprecated and will be removed in JFlex 1.7.


See also the [change log](history.html) file for the complete list of changes.

## What platforms does JFlex support?

JFlex should run on any platform that supports a JRE/JDK 1.5 or above.
