# JFlex Mailing Lists

JFlex has three public mailing lists hosted by [sourceforge.net](http://sourceforge.net).

-   `jflex-announce` for those who would like to be notified of new JFlex releases and severe bugs. This list is read only and very low traffic. Your email address will be kept private.

    `jflex-announce`
    [infos/subscribe/unsubscribe](http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/jflex-announce)
    [archive](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum=jflex-announce)

-   `jflex-users` for help and discussions about bugs/features/whatever. The list is not moderated and writable for subscribers only. Your email address will only be visible if you post to the list.

    To prevent abuse you will receive a request for confirmation. If you reply to that request from the same address you wished to subscribe, you should receive a final confirmation that your subscription to the list was successful. If  you encounter any problems, send mail to [Gerwin Klein](mailto:lsf@jflex.de).
